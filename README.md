With OBA Easy Essay children who have to make an essay can easily find information about their subjects, and then, with the help of the essay template, see where this information can be placed in their essay, the introduction, conclusion and the different chapters give tips on what kind of information should go in that part of the essay so the kids can focus on finding the best information possible.

The API i used is the OBA API which contains information about all books available. Information about the books contain the author, a summary, a link to the detail page on the OBA website and a lot more. The API has a maximum amount of request of 200 for every hour.
